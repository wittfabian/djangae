# Gauth

Djangae includes two applications to aid authentication and user management with
App Engine. Each provides both an abstract class, to extend if you're defining your own custom User model, or a concrete version to use in place of `'django.contrib.auth.models.User'`.  Also provided are custom authentication backends which delegate to the App Engine users API and a middleware to handle the link between the Django's user object and App Engine's (amongst other things).

The only minor difference between Djangae Gauth and Django Auth is that Djangae overrides `normalize_email` to lowercase whole email, not just the domain part like Django does. See rationale behind this decision in [issue #481 on Github](https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae/issues/481).

## Using the Datastore

Allows the use of Django's permissions system on the Datastore, despite it usually requiring many-to-many relationships, which are not supported on the Datastore.

### Setup

1. Add `'djangae.contrib.gauth.datastore'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` probably
after `'django.contrib.auth'`.
2. Replace `'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'` with
`'djangae.contrib.gauth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'`.
3. Set `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'djangae.GaeDatastoreUser'` in your settings file to use the supplied user model, or create your own by subclassing `djangae.contrib.gauth.datastore.models.GaeAbstractDatastoreUser`.
4. Add the backend to `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` in your settings file eg:

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
	'djangae.contrib.gauth.datastore.backends.AppEngineUserAPIBackend',
	 ...
)
```

### Permissions

The Datastore-based user models have a `user_permissions` list field, which takes the place of the usual many-to-many relationship to a `Permission` model.  For groups, Djangae provides `djangae.contrib.gauth.Group`, which again has a list field for storing the permissions.  This `Group` model is registered with the Django admin automatically for you.


## Using a relational database (CloudSQL)


### Setup

1. Add `'djangae.contrib.gauth.sql'` to `INSTALLED_APPS` probably
after `'django.contrib.auth'`.
2. Replace `'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'` with
`'djangae.contrib.gauth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware'`.
3. Set `AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'djangae.GaeUser'` in your settings file to use the supplied user model or create your own by subclassing `djangae.contrib.gauth.sql.models.GaeAbstractUser`.
4. Add the backend to `AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` in your settings file eg:

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
	'djangae.contrib.gauth.sql.backends.AppEngineUserAPIBackend',
	 ...
)
```


## Using your own permissions system

If you want to write your own permissions system, but you still want to take advantage of the authentication provided by the Google Users API, then you may want to subclass `djangae.contrib.gauth.common.models.GaeAbstractBaseUser`.


## Authentication for Unknown Users

By default Djangae will deny access for unknown users (unless the user is an administrator for the App Engine application).

Add `DJANGAE_CREATE_UNKNOWN_USER=True` to your settings and Djangae will always grant access (for authenticated Google Accounts users), creating a Django user if one does not exist.

If there is a Django user with a matching email address and username set to `None` then Djangae will update the Django user, setting the username to the Google user ID. If there is a user with a matching email address and username set to another user ID then Djangae will set the existing user's email address to `None` and create a new Django user.

App Engine administrators are always granted access, and a Django user will be created if one does not exist.


## Username/password authentication

As well as using Djangae's Google Accounts-based authentication, you can also use the standard authentication backend from django.contrib.auth.  They can work alongside each other.  Simply include both, like this:

```python
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
    'djangae.contrib.gauth.datastore.backends.AppEngineUserAPIBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
)

MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'djangae.contrib.gauth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
)
```

## Switching accounts

There is a `switch_accounts` view which allows a user to change which of their Google accounts they're logged in with.

The URL for the user to be sent to afterwards should be provided in `request.GET['next']``.

Learn more about [Google multiple sign-in on App Engine here](https://p.ota.to/blog/2014/2/google-multiple-sign-in-on-app-engine/).

### Example usage:

Include GAuth urls in your main urls.py file.

```python
url(r'^gauth/', include(djangae.contrib.gauth.urls))
```

Use this URL to add "Switch account" functionality for user:

```html
<a href="{% url 'djangae_switch_accounts' %}">Switch account</a>
```
